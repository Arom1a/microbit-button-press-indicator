# micro:bit Button Press Indicator

On the [micro:bit hardware details page](https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/), I saw

> Front buttons A and B ... are debounced by software, which also includes short press, long press, and ‘both A+B’ press detection.

So, why not write an async button press detection program as a practice?
